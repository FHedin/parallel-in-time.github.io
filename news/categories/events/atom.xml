<!--more-->
<p>With the aim to successfully continue the PinT workshop series even beyond the
<a href="/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">5th workshop</a> in Banff,
Canada, a set of <a href="/events/bylaws.html">bylaws</a> for the election of a scientific committee has been
put in place during the workshop in <a href="/events/past/2015/4th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">Dresden</a>.
The bylaws define a set of rules for the election of a scientific committee.
The committee is responsible for the coordination and promotion of the workshop series.
We are looking forward to many more interesting PinT workshops!</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="/events/past/2015/4th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">4th PinT workshop</a> in
Dresden turned out to be another great event in the <em>Parallel-in-time integration</em> workshop series:
With 40 participants from 9 different countries, this workshop again provided a lively forum for
many interesting discussions around a great many different aspects of PinT.
With several well-known researchers from the climate and atmospheric science community present,
fascinating discussions emerged about the feasibility of using parallel-in-time integration methods
in climate simulations and numerical weather prediction.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order to support the continuation of the workshop series,
<a href="/events/bylaws.html">a set of bylaws</a> has been put in place and the first election of a scientific
committee will take place within four weeks after the workshop.</p>

<p>Certainly, everybody is now looking forward to the
<a href="/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">5th workshop</a> in the
series in November 2016 in Canada.</p>
