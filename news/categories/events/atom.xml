    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The election for the scientific committee is now closed and the results available. As we had 7 candidates for 7 open positions, the outcome is not a big surprise. Nevertheless, the first election of a scientific committee will hopefully be an important milestone and help to successfully continue the PINT workshop series for many years to come.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The following colleagues have been elected as members of the first scientific committee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Martin J. Gander, University of Geneva, Switzerland</li>
  <li>Stefan Güttel, University of Manchester, UK</li>
  <li>Ron Haynes, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada</li>
  <li>Rolf Krause, University of Lugano, Switzerland,</li>
  <li>Daniel Ruprecht, University of Lugano, Switzerland (soon: University of Leeds, UK)</li>
  <li>Jacob Schroder, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, USA</li>
  <li>Robert Speck, Jülich Supercomputing Centre, Germany</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Support from Michael Klöppel at TU Dresden is thankfully acknowledged</strong>: he served as the voting committee and set up and administrated the election through the <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/">helios</a> online voting system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bylaws for the parallel-in-time workshop series.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>With the aim to successfully continue the PinT workshop series even beyond the
<a href="/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">5th workshop</a> in Banff,
Canada, a set of <a href="/events/bylaws.html">bylaws</a> for the election of a scientific committee has been
put in place during the workshop in <a href="/events/past/2015/4th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">Dresden</a>.
The bylaws define a set of rules for the election of a scientific committee.
The committee is responsible for the coordination and promotion of the workshop series.
We are looking forward to many more interesting PinT workshops!</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="/events/past/2015/4th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">4th PinT workshop</a> in
Dresden turned out to be another great event in the <em>Parallel-in-time integration</em> workshop series:
With 40 participants from 9 different countries, this workshop again provided a lively forum for
many interesting discussions around a great many different aspects of PinT.
With several well-known researchers from the climate and atmospheric science community present,
fascinating discussions emerged about the feasibility of using parallel-in-time integration methods
in climate simulations and numerical weather prediction.</p>

<p>Moreover, in order to support the continuation of the workshop series,
<a href="/events/bylaws.html">a set of bylaws</a> has been put in place and the first election of a scientific
committee will take place within four weeks after the workshop.</p>

<p>Certainly, everybody is now looking forward to the
<a href="/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">5th workshop</a> in the
series in November 2016 in Canada.</p>
