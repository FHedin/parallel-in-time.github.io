<!--more-->
<p>With the aim to successfully continue the PinT workshop series even beyond the
<a href="/events/upcoming/2016/5th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">5th workshop</a> in Banff,
Canada, a set of <a href="/events/bylaws.html">bylaws</a> for the election of a scientific committee has been
put in place during the workshop in <a href="/events/past/2015/4th-workshop-on-parallel-in-time-integration.html">Dresden</a>.
The bylaws define a set of rules for the election of a scientific committee.
The committee is responsible for the coordination and promotion of the workshop series.
We are looking forward to many more interesting PinT workshops!</p>
